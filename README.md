This project aims to use ensemble learning methods to predict the price of Airbnb listings in New York City. The data set used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains around 47,000 listings in New York City in 2019.
This project is part of the Ensemble Learning course at CentraleSupélec. The project was done in collaboration with Shamir Mohammed, Alban Sarfati, Thomas Taylor, and Elie Trigano.

Introduction
Airbnb has disrupted the hospitality industry by offering individuals the opportunity to list their own properties as rental places. However, determining the optimal price for a listing can be challenging, and the variation in types of listings can make it difficult for renters to get an accurate sense of fair pricing. This project aims to use ensemble learning methods to predict the price of Airbnb listings in New York City.

Dataset
Description
The data set used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains around 47,000 listings in New York City in 2019. The data set includes 15 features on listings, including the name of the listing, neighborhood, price, review information, and availability.

Access to the Data
The data set can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data

Objectives:
- Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data set
- Preprocess the data set
- Perform feature engineering
- Try different a decistion tree and different ensemble learning methods to predict the price of a listing
- Compare the results of the different models
